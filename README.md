## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have an appropriate VHDL simulator installed (e.g., ModelSim, GHDL).
2. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/JhonathanNicolas/VHDL-Nexus.git`
3. Navigate to the specific challenge folder, read the provided instructions, and start coding!
4. Test your solution using the provided testbench or create your own.


## Repository Structure by Difficulty Level

This repository is organized based on the difficulty level of the challenges, ensuring a progressive learning experience for everyone. Here's a breakdown of the structure:

### Newer

For those who are new to VHDL and digital design, the challenges in this section will introduce basic concepts and simple logic designs. It's an ideal starting point if you're taking your first steps in VHDL.

- Path: `./Newer/`
- **Example Challenges**:
  - Basic logic gates implementation
  - Simple multiplexers and demultiplexers

### Intermediate

Once you're comfortable with the basics, the intermediate challenges will introduce you to more complex designs, including finite state machines, arithmetic circuits, and memory elements.

- Path: `./Intermediate/`
- **Example Challenges**:
  - 4-bit ALU design
  - Basic counters and shift registers

### Advanced

For those who have a good grasp on VHDL and are looking to tackle more intricate problems, the advanced challenges will present designs that might involve multiple components working together and might touch on certain real-world applications.

- Path: `./Advanced/`
- **Example Challenges**:
  - Pipelined processors
  - Memory interfaces and controllers

### Engineer

Aimed at seasoned FPGA engineers or those who want to push their limits. The challenges in this section are reminiscent of professional-level problems and might involve optimizations, meeting timing constraints, and more.

- Path: `./Engineer/`
- **Example Challenges**:
  - Complex system-on-chip design
  - High-speed serial interfaces
  - Custom peripheral development for standard buses (e.g., SPI, I2C)

Within each directory's challenge folder, there is an INSTRUCTIONS.md file detailing the problem's specifications. For challenges generated by ChatGPT, you'll find the markdown #generatedByChatGPT at the top of the INSTRUCTIONS.md file to distinguish them.

### Solution Suggestions
Inside each challenge folder, there's a directory named `solution` where you can find a suggested solution for the given problem (when it has done). Please note that this is merely a suggestion, and there might be multiple valid and efficient ways to solve a particular challenge. We encourage exploring various solutions and comparing them for learning purposes.
