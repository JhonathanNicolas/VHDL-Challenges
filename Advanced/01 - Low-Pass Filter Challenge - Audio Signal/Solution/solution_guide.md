# Solution Guide: Low-Pass FIR Filter Design & Quantization

## Introduction

This guide elaborates on the process of designing a low-pass Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter and subsequently quantizing its coefficients to 16-bit precision. This is essential for real-world applications where the filter is to be implemented in digital systems that operate with fixed-point arithmetic or specific bit-width requirements.

## 1. FIR Filter Design

### Why FIR?

FIR filters have several advantages:
- Stability is guaranteed since they are non-recursive.
- Linear phase response can be achieved.
- Easy implementation in hardware.

### Designing the FIR Filter

To design the filter, we use the `firwin` function from the `scipy.signal` module. This function allows us to specify the number of taps (coefficients), the cutoff frequency, the sampling frequency, and the windowing technique.

For this solution:
- **Number of Taps**: 64
- **Cutoff Frequency**: 1 kHz
- **Sampling Frequency**: 44.1 kHz
- **Window**: Hamming

The filter coefficients (`h`) can be obtained with:
```python
h = firwin(taps, cutoff, window="hamming", fs=fs)
```

## 2. Visualizing the Frequency Response

Before quantization, it's good to visualize the frequency response of the filter. This helps us to verify its behavior and ensure that it meets our requirements.

Using the `freqz` function, we can obtain the frequency response (`H`) of our filter:
```python
w, H = freqz(h, worN=8000, fs=fs)
```

A plot of the frequency (in Hz) against amplitude (in dB) gives us a visual representation.

## 3. Quantization of Filter Coefficients

Real-world systems, especially hardware like FPGAs or ASICs, often don't support floating-point arithmetic due to resource constraints. Therefore, we quantize the filter coefficients to 16-bit values.

### Quantization Process

1. **Normalization**: Scale the coefficients so their maximum absolute value is 1.
2. **Scaling**: Multiply the normalized coefficients by a scaling factor (e.g., 32767 for 16-bit quantization).
3. **Rounding**: Round the scaled values to the nearest integer.
4. **Casting**: Convert the rounded values to the desired data type (e.g., 16-bit integers).

The quantization can be performed as:
```python
h_quantized = quantize_to_16bits(h)
```

## 4. Visualizing the Quantized Filter's Frequency Response

After quantization, it's crucial to verify that the filter's performance hasn't been significantly compromised. This can be done by plotting its frequency response just as we did for the original filter.

## 5. Implementing the Filter

With the quantized coefficients, the filter is now ready for implementation in a digital system. These coefficients can be loaded into the hardware or software system, and the filter can be applied to input samples using convolution.
