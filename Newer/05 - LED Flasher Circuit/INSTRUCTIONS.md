# LED Flasher Circuit Challenge
## #generatedByChatGPT

### Objective:
Design a circuit that alternately flashes two LEDs. Introduce a delay mechanism so the flashing is visible to the human eye.

### Requirements:
#### Inputs:
- CLOCK
- RESET
  
#### Outputs:
- LED1
- LED2

### Guidelines:

1. **VHDL Files**: Create individual VHDL files for the delay mechanism and the LED control logic.

2. **Top Module**: Instantiate the components in a top module (e.g., `top_led_flasher.vhdl`) and wire them appropriately.

3. **Testing**: Use a testbench to simulate the flashing sequence. Ensure a clear alternating pattern between LED1 and LED2.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Alternating flash between LED1 and LED2 with noticeable delay.
- Proper integration in the top module.
- Clean VHDL code with clear comments.
